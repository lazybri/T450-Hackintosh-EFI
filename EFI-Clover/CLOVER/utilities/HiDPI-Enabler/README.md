# One Button MacOS HIDPI

The purpose of this script is to enable the `HiDPI` option for low to medium resolution screens and have a native `HiDPI` setting that can be set in the system monitor settings without the `RDM` software.

The `dpi` mechanism of `MacOS` is not the same as `win`. For example, the `1080p` screen has the scaling options of `125%`, `150%` under `win`, and the same screen is in `MacOS`. Next, the zoom option simply adjusts the resolution, which makes the font and `UI` look small at the default resolution, and the resolution is blurred.

At the same time, this script can also fix the splash screen by injecting the patched `EDID`, or the splash screen after wake-up after sleep. Of course, this fix varies from person to person.

### How to use?
----------------
Download the latest enable-HiDPI.sh by entering the following command in a terminal window:

``` sh
curl -o ~/enable-HiDPI.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscl/Enable-HiDPI-OSX/master/enable-HiDPI.sh
```
Download the latest restore program just in case the ```enable-HiDPI``` stall the system
```sh
curl -o ~/restore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscl/Enable-HiDPI-OSX/master/restore
```

This will download enable-HiDPI.sh and restore.sh to your home directory (~) and the next step is to change the permissions of the file (add +x) so that it can be run.
 
``` sh
chmod +x ~/enable-HiDPI.sh
chmod +x ~/restore
```


Run the script in a terminal window by:

``` sh
~/enable-HiDPI.sh
```

Once you finish injecting the HiDPI values, reboot your OS X and use Retina Display Menu  (RDM) to choose the resolution you want.


###How to restore?
----------------
Go to ```single``` mode in macOS, enter the following
```sh
/sbin/fsck -fy /
/sbin/mount -uw /
```
This will make your root filesystem avaiable to read and write, we then go to the home directory of your unix user name, suppose my user name is ```syscl```, then I should type in 
```sh
cd /User/syscl
./restore
```
Choose the restore point you want it to restore, then type in reboot to restore back to original 
```sh
reboot
```

## Important: 

If you can't enter the system after using this script, please go to the recovery mode and delete the folder corresponding to the display `VendorID` under the terminal delete `/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` and put `backup`. The backup in the folder is copied.

The specific commands are as follows:

```
$ cd /Volumes/macOS\ Mojave/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
$ VendorID=$(ioreg -l | grep "DisplayVendorID" | awk '{print $8}')
$ Vid=$(echo "obase=16;$VendorID" | bc | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
$ rm -rf ./DisplayVendorID-$Vid
$ cp -r ./backup/* ./
```
