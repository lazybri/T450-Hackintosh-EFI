# One Button MacOS HIDPI

The purpose of this script is to enable the `HiDPI` option for low to medium resolution screens and have a native `HiDPI` setting that can be set in the system monitor settings without the `RDM` software.

The `dpi` mechanism of `MacOS` is not the same as `win`. For example, the `1080p` screen has the scaling options of `125%`, `150%` under `win`, and the same screen is in `MacOS`. Next, the zoom option simply adjusts the resolution, which makes the font and `UI` look small at the default resolution, and the resolution is blurred.

At the same time, this script can also fix the splash screen by injecting the patched `EDID`, or the splash screen after wake-up after sleep. Of course, this fix varies from person to person.

$ cd /Volumes/macOS\ Mojave/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
$ VendorID=$(ioreg -l | grep "DisplayVendorID" | awk '{print $8}')
$ Vid=$(echo "obase=16;$VendorID" | bc | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
$ rm -rf ./DisplayVendorID-$Vid
$ cp -r ./backup/* ./
```
