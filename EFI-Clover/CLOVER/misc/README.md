# Clove Bootloader Miscellaneous Folder

This folder will contain all of the themes you want to use with Clover Bootloader. The theme applies to the Clover boot screen that loads in the beginning of your computers powering on. You can choose any theme you want and use Clover Configurator to set the theme under GUI options or you can edit your config.plist directly and set the theme there.

### Logo

- Contains the screenshot shown on the main Github page for my build

### Plists

- Backup of the current plists for this project. I find it necessary to have a backup in place just incase something happens to the plist you're currently using or it becomes unusable for some reason you can always copy and paste this working one or any other configurations you may possibly have and use them instead in order to fix startup issues. I will always update this directory with the most up to date version of the plists in use for this project.
