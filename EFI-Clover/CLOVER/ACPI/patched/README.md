# Patched ACPI Files

Patched .aml configuration files are inserted here and Clover will inject them at boot time in order to modify the ACPI codebase with all changes present in the individual files. 

- This folder contains all SSDT files and not DSDT because the configuration method is based on Hot Patching.
