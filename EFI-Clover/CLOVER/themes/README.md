# Clove Bootloader Themes

This folder will contain all of the themes you want to use with Clover Bootloader. The theme applies to the Clover boot screen that loads in the beginning of your computers powering on. You can choose any theme you want and use Clover Configurator to set the theme under GUI options or you can edit your config.plist directly and set the theme there.

### FlatCamp

- FlatCamp is my personal favorite theme. Its a clean and simple looking setup and contains the macOS stock startup sound which I like. I prefer using this theme over all others I've come across but you're welcom to use any other themes you may like more.
